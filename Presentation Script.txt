Slide 1: Title Slide
Script:
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I will be presenting our project on using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify brain tumors from MRI images. My name is [Your Name], and I'll walk you through the key aspects and findings of our project."

Slide 2: Introduction
Script:
"Our objective was to develop a deep learning model to accurately classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment, and automated classification can assist radiologists in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses."

Slide 3: Dataset Overview
Script:
"We used a dataset consisting of [number] MRI images. These were split into two categories: images with brain tumors and healthy images. Each image was resized to 128x128 pixels and converted to grayscale for uniformity."

Slide 4: Data Preprocessing
Script:
"Data preprocessing involved loading the images, resizing them to a consistent 128x128 pixels, and normalizing pixel values to a range of 0 to 1. Here are some examples of the images we used."

Slide 5: Custom Dataset and DataLoader
Script:
"To efficiently handle our dataset, we created a custom PyTorch Dataset class, which allowed us to load and preprocess images with their corresponding labels. Using PyTorch's DataLoader, we could batch-process and shuffle the data during training, ensuring better model performance."

Slide 6: CNN Model Architecture
Script:
"Our CNN model consists of several layers: two convolutional layers with tanh activation functions, followed by average pooling layers for downsampling, and three fully connected layers for classification. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output a binary classification."

Slide 7: Training the Model
Script:
"Training involved using the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function and the Adam optimizer. We trained the model over [number] epochs, monitoring the loss and accuracy throughout. This plot shows the training and validation loss over the epochs."

Slide 8: Model Evaluation
Script:
"We evaluated our model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Here, you can see the confusion matrix, which provides insight into the model's performance, including metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score."

Slide 9: Feature Map Visualization
Script:
"To understand what the model is learning at each layer, we extracted and visualized feature maps from the convolutional layers. These visualizations help us interpret the network's learning process and ensure it's focusing on relevant features."

Slide 10: Overfitting and Model Validation
Script:
"To check for overfitting, we split our data into training and validation sets. Monitoring the accuracy on both sets over the epochs helps us understand if the model generalizes well. Here, we compare the training and validation accuracy."

Slide 11: Conclusion
Script:
"In conclusion, our CNN model successfully classified brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics, providing a tool to assist radiologists in early tumor detection."

Slide 12: Future Work
Script:
"Future work could include using a larger dataset, experimenting with different network architectures, and further tuning hyperparameters. Our goal is to integrate this model into clinical workflows to assist in real-world medical diagnostics."

Slide 13: Q&A
Script:
"Thank you for your attention. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have."
